# Introduction

Topheman Bombs is a free __HTML5 / Javascript__ game that takes advantage of the canvas element and the accelerometer on your device.

And you can **play offline** (in the subway or whatever ...), or on your **desktop browser via the emulator** !

* Tilt your device to manage the blue dot
* Tap the screen to drop bombs on the enemies (red dots)
* Grab the green dots to get more bombs

# Development

## Ball.js

The game is based on [Ball.js](https://github.com/topheman/Ball.js), a JavaScript class that handles __physics interactions__ between balls on a flat area (i.e. collisions) as well as __rendering__, I made in early 2012.

## Previous versions

This project was started in 2012, using Grunt, requireJS and a few vintage techs - it still works!

More infos on [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Grunt Workflow Boilerplate

In the end of 2013 first semester, after finishing [boxboxevents](https://github.com/topheman/boxbox), I was working on a game and I re-discovered [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) with the v0.4.

I explain my __[grunt workflow here](GRUNTWORKFLOW.md)__ with all the different tasks such as :

* building
* server testing
* ftp deploying
* creating html5 manifest
* â€¦

Feel free to take a look.
